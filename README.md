# Holy Sepulchre Gear

## STORY BEHIND
The original mod was outdated and didn't work completely. Since it was released a while back it also doesn't use patched table files. After getting the permission from [RedHazmat](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/users/51918456) to create an update of the original Mod, I began working on it.

## DESCRIPTION
This is the most complete armor mod for KC:D so far. It includes the armor in two variants (silver and gold), all accessories, a set of weapons and every item you need for your beloved horse. Hopefully with the best available stats you can get. Each item has its unique version 4 UUID and can be bought. No more texture replacements! The known bug of the original mod by not showing a texture for Caparison and Gauntlets is gone. English and German localization included.
