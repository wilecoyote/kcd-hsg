## STORY BEHIND
The original mod was outdated and didn't work completely. Since it was released a while back it also doesn't use patched table files. After getting the permission from [RedHazmat](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/users/51918456) to create an update of the original Mod, I began working on it.

## DESCRIPTION
This is the most complete armor mod for KC:D so far. It includes the armor in two variants (silver and gold), all accessories, a set of weapons and every item you need for your beloved horse. Hopefully with the best available stats you can get. Each item has its unique version 4 UUID and can be bought. No more texture replacements! The known bug of the original mod by not showing a texture for Caparison and Gauntlets is gone. English and German localization included.

### Compatibility
Unless otherwise noted, all my mods are compatible with each other as tables are patched but not overwritten.

If you use my mods in combination with older ones that completely overwrite tables, you should pay attention to the loading order. **However, it is not recommended to do this!**
