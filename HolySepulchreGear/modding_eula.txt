4. MODDING TERMS  

4.1 Warhorse enables users of the Software to enhance their experience from using the Software through the creation of modifications (including but not limited to new items in the Software such as weapons, apparels and appearance of the characters) for use with the Software (such modifications are hereinafter called “Mod” or “Mods”). In order to protect Warhorse, the Software and any third-party licensors that have licensed intellectual property to Warhorse for use in the Software, and users that create or use Mods, the following terms under this article “Modding Terms” shall apply (hereinafter such terms shall be hereinafter referred to as “Modding Terms”).  The Modding Terms are inherent part of EULA and shall be without any prejudice to the other provisions of EULA, which in case of any conflict shall prevail over the Modding Terms.  

4.2 You acknowledge that you are not under age of fifteen. In the event that you are under such an age, you may not create any Mods, unless your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these terms. The license we provide to you to create and use Mods with the Product may be revoked if you breach the Modding Terms. 

4.3 You acknowledge that you shall have no ownership or other proprietary interest in the Software  as a result of you creating the Mods. You also acknowledge that you shall have no rights or proprietary interest in  any Mods which you create, unless and only that are expressly stated herein.  

Any Mods that you create shall belong to you only insofar as the Mod contains your original creative work. You acknowledge and agree that all right, title and interest in any elements of the Mod which represent, comprise, derive or are based upon any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Software (including but not limited to any computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialogs, catch phrases, locations, concepts, artwork, images, animation, sounds, musical compositions, audio-visual effects or text), including without limitation copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual properties therein and/or related thereto, whether or not registered or registrable, are owned by, or for the benefit of Warhorse and its licensors. 

4.4 Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of the EULA and in particular the Modding Terms, Warhorse hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited, fully revocable right and license to install, access and use the in-game modding tools and any other related tools provided by Warhorse (“Modding Tools”) solely and exclusively to create Mods for use with the Software  and to publish those Mods to the following web page: https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance (“Modding Page”) or to share with other existing authorized users of the Software for non-commercial gain in the manner approved from time to time by Warhorse. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Modding Page is at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any obligations, damages or losses which arise from your registration, access and use of this service. 

4.5 You agree to use the Modding Tools to create Mods in a manner that is consistent with this EULA, including an agreement that you shall not sell, rent, lease, license, distribute or otherwise transfer or exploit the Modding Tools and/or Mods or any copies thereof, for commercial gain or otherwise, except as permitted by this EULA, which means that you may only publish the Mod to the Modding Page or to share with other existing authorized users of the Software for non-commercial gain in the manner approved from time to time by Warhorse. A breach of the provisions of this license shall constitute a material breach which has the effect of terminating the EULA (including the Modding Terms) and which may subject you to civil and criminal liability. 

4.6 Any element which you include in your Mod must be your own original work created by you or you must have obtained the necessary permissions to use such materials. You are responsible for the content of any Mods which you create and publish on the Modding Page and shall warrant and represent to Warhorse your Mods do not contain: 1. any materials which are discriminatory, racist, obscene, libelous, offensive, illegal, defamatory, inappropriate, invasive, or likely to adversely affect the reputation or goodwill of Warhorse and/or its licensors; 2. any resemblance to any recognizable third party brand, character or personality, including but not limited to any trademark, logos or third party assets except for those assets provided to you by Warhorse as necessary for the creation of the Mod for use with the Product; 3. any third party assets, from other games published by Warhorse and its affiliates or any other third party; 4. any materials which do not comply with any additional instructions provided to you by Warhorse, which may be updated by Warhorse from time to time, as published on its web page or the Modding Page; 5. any malicious code, including viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, corrupted data, or other content that contains malicious code or in any way damages or interfere with the operation of the Software. Warhorse shall not pre-vet or monitor any Mods which are uploaded to the Modding Page or are shared with other users and does not monitor, endorse or approve any Mods. You are solely responsible for your Mod and may be held liable for any Mod which you create and upload to the Modding Page or share with other users of the Software. Warhorse reserves the right, in its sole and final discretion, to request removal of any Mods from the Modding Page which violate the content restrictions above or request any person to remove any Mods from the Software used by such a person. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Warhorse does not assume any responsibility or liability for the Mods or for removal of, Mods or any failure to or delay in removing, such Mods.
